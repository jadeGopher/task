# Description 
Thus, jaicp provided their API in OpenAPI format
(possible download from [here](https://app.jaicp.com/reporter/static/specs/reporter-public-en.html))
I've decided to generate API client.

# Setting up environment
Firstly you need to install openapi (here link to installation [guide](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/)).

Then you need to open terminal in project folder and execute command `make generate_api`.

Congratulations! Everything is done and you can run testing task.
